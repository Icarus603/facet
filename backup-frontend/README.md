# FACET Frontend Design Backup

This folder contains the essential frontend components and design work that took days to create.

## 🔷 Diamond Components (Masterpieces)
- `components/ui/diamond-logo.tsx` - Realistic diamond with facets and light reflection
- `components/ui/facet-logo.tsx` - 128-point SVG brilliant cut diamond with FACET branding

## 💬 Chat Interface System
- `components/chat/` - Complete chat interface with sophisticated animations
- `pages/chat-page.tsx` - Main chat page with Claude-inspired collapsible sidebar

## 🎨 Brand Design System
- `styles/globals.css` - Complete FACET color palette and brand system
- `config/tailwind.config.ts` - Custom FACET color extensions and utilities

## 🏗️ Key Design Features Preserved
- FACET Blue (#2C84DB) to Wine (#C41E3A) gradient system
- 300ms smooth transitions for sidebar collapse/expand
- Times New Roman typography for FACET branding
- Complex SVG diamond geometry with multiple gradient overlays
- Cultural profile integration throughout UI

## Integration Notes
These components should be restored into the new Next.js 15.3 structure while maintaining:
- All animation timings and transition effects
- Complete brand color consistency
- Diamond logo scaling and hover effects
- Sidebar state management and smooth animations
- Cultural context display patterns

**DO NOT MODIFY** - These are reference implementations to be restored exactly.
